Key metrics:
* controller ability to map the correct network topology
* topology discovery time by controller
* end to end flow installation rate (ms)
* open flow controllers install flow table entries that enable end-to-end paths

* respond to DDOS attack by rules automatically 
*SDN: networking controlled by programs => easier to modify network configuration
* new framework that can control network based on analyzing the network traffic data

SDN generally notes: https://quizlet.com/72153235/software-defined-networking-sdn-flash-cards/
* pay-as-you-go models
* network virtualization for multi-tenants => better utilization of resources and faster turnaround times for creating a segregated network

3 tiered architecture:
* physical network equipment (ethernet switches, routers)
* controllers: initiate & terminate traffic using a library
* applications to direct security through the controller

Why SDN applications: https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/need-sdn-applications-developed/2013/10/
* content availability: provision flows based on the type and availability of the content
* service availability: know the availability of network services before routing data
* bandwidth management 
* issue: northbound APIs aren't standardized and each SDN controller vendor has their own

Really nice SDN summary: https://community.brocade.com/t5/SDN-NFV/Looking-at-SDN-and-OpenFlow-with-Simple-Examples/ba-p/21
* traditional networking requires applications (control plane) on each switch
