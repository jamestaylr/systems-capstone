To do once on each machine: 
	sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		*add the line "PermitTunnel yes"
	sudo service ssh restart
	
Setup:
Each machine:
	cd to mininet/util
	ifconfig and take note of each eth1 ip address
	./clustersetup.sh ip1 ip2 
		ip1 and ip2 are the ip addresses of the other two machines
		this only works if the setup is done on every machine
		usually has to be done all on three machines simultaneously otherwise it hangs

Main machine: 
	sudo -E mn --topo tree,3,3 --cluster localip,ip1,ip2

Tear down on each machine:
	./clustersetup.sh -c ip1 ip2
		may cause "busy" errors- it has to be done in a certain order, so call the command until all three succeed or are not mounted
