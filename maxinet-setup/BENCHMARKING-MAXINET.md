# Basic Benchmarks
* We can time the execution of simple scripts:
  > time [python program]
* We can time how long it takes to change topology
* We can time how long it takes to set up with different topologies initially [see link](http://vlkan.com/blog/post/2013/04/19/benchmarking-mininet/)

# [other benchmarks](https://www.necam.com/docs/?id=2709888a-ecfd-4157-8849-1d18144a6dda)

KeY metrics:
* Controller ability to map the correct network topology
* Topology discovery time by controller
* End to end flow installation rate (ms)
* Open flow controllers install flow table entries that enable end-to-end paths
