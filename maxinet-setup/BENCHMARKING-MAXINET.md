# basic benchmarks
* we can time the execution of simple scripts:
  > time [python program]
* we can time how long it takes to change topology
* we can time how long it takes to set up with different topologies initially [see link](http://vlkan.com/blog/post/2013/04/19/benchmarking-mininet/)

# [other benchmarks](https://www.necam.com/docs/?id=2709888a-ecfd-4157-8849-1d18144a6dda)

Key metrics:
* controller ability to map the correct network topology
* topology discovery time by controller
* end to end flow installation rate (ms)
* open flow controllers install flow table entries that enable end-to-end paths
